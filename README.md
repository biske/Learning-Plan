# Learning-Plan

Areas that need improvement
----------

* CSS and front end CSS frameworks
* Ruby Design Patterns
* Going beyond the basics of Javascript
* Understanding JSON, AJAX, and APIs
* Sort out my ReadMes
* Learning how to programme in a team

Long-Term Goals
----------
Whilst I would like to be able to do fullstack programming, I am currently much more interested in back end than front end. I would like to have a range of languages under my belt, but am less interested in learning things (in depth) that only relate front end.


Books I'm reading / planning to read
----------

* The Well Grounded Rubyist (currently at Chapter 13)
* Practical Object Oriented Design (current at Chapter 5)
* JavaScript The Good Parts
* JavaScript & JQuery, Duckett


Plan
-------
Possibilities: 
* Working my way through JavaScript the Good Parts
* Working with a group of people to create a well designed ruby app to fit a brief that changes throughout the week
* Trying to learn something new - Volt? (as I have a preference for Ruby) CoffeeScript? Ember? Meteor? (as it'd be good to have diversity)
* Writing an app that involves using Datascraping
* Try playing with hardware - ardouino? (I realise I couldn't achieve an awful lot in a week, but could play about and maybe it'd enable me to use it for a final project)
* Finish off Battleships Web
* Finish artist's website (started before the course) using jQuery
