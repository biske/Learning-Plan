Plan
-------
Possibilities: 
* Working my way through JavaScript the Good Parts
* Working with a group of people to create a well designed ruby app to fit a brief that changes throughout the week
* Trying to learn something new - Volt? (as I have a preference for Ruby) CoffeeScript? Ember? Meteor? (as it'd be good to have diversity)
* Try playing with hardware - ardouino? (I realise I couldn't achieve an awful lot in a week, but could play about and maybe it'd enable me to use it for a final project)
* Finish off Battleships Web
* Finish artist's website (started before the course) using jQuery
