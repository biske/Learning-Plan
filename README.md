# Learning-Plan

Areas that need improvement
----------

* CSS and front end CSS frameworks
* Ruby Design Patterns
* Going beyond the basics of Javascript
* Understanding JSON, AJAX, and APIs
* Sort out my ReadMes
* Learning how to programme in a team
* Need to start a blog - have bought emily.codes domain, but haven't managed to set up server properly.
* Need to start doing codewars
* Need to start reading others' code

Long-Term Goals
----------
Whilst I would like to be able to do fullstack programming, I am currently much more interested in back end than front end. I would like to have a range of languages under my belt, but am less interested in learning things (in depth) that only relate to front end.


Books I'm reading / planning to read
----------

* The Well Grounded Rubyist (currently at Ch. 13)
* Practical Object Oriented Design (current at Ch. 5)
* Eloquent JavaScript (currently mid-way through Ch. 6 (OOD), although a lot of Ch. 5 (Func. Prog.) eluded me)
* JavaScript The Good Parts
* JavaScript & JQuery, Duckett


Possibilities
-------------
* Working my way through JavaScript the Good Parts
* Working with a group of people to create a well designed ruby app to fit a brief that changes throughout the week
* Trying to learn something new - Volt? (as I have a preference for Ruby) CoffeeScript? Ember? Meteor? (as it'd be good to have diversity)
* Writing an app that involves using Datascraping
* Try playing with hardware - ardouino? (I realise I couldn't achieve an awful lot in a week, but could play about and maybe it'd enable me to use it for a final project)
* Finish off Battleships Web
* Finish artist's website (started before the course) using jQuery
* Set up server for emily.codes and start blog
* Start thinking about Node - learnyounode at nodeschool.io

Plan
-------
To spend Monday & Tuesday finishing reading through Eloquent JavaScript and JavaScript The Good Parts
To spend Wednesday & Thursday learning something new (Ember? Meteor? Volt? Arduino?)
To spend Friday setting up server, starting blog, finishing ReadMes, and beginning Mihai's Weekend Challenge (using APIs and JSONs)
To spend the weekend finishing Mihai's challenge and preparing for Node via nodeschool
